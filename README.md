X-ray diffraction model for Talbot interferometry and phase contrast imaging
============================================================================
# Features
* This model can be used for example to simulate grating based x-ray imaging methods such as dark field and phase contrast imaging.
* Geant4 is used for modeling geometry and physics.
* Fftw3 is used for calculating the wave propagation.
* The accuracy of this numerical model has been validated against a rigorous model that can be solved for simple geometries using Monte Carlo integration.
